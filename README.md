# Identify-potential-biomarkers-of-pancreatic-cancer

<br />

Step 1: Download RNA-seq samples from normal and tumor tissues of pancreatic cancer patients and protein expression data of tumor tissues of pancreatic cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas

<br />

Step 2: Perform quantile normalization followed by PCA

<br />

Step 3: Calculate Z-scores for each transcript in tumor and normal RNA-seq samples seperately 

<br />

Step 4: Calculate fold changes for each transcript in tumor and normal RNA-seq samples

<br />

Step 6: Calculate Z-scores for each protein 

<br />

Step 7: Map transcript to its corresponding protein

<br />

Step 8: Identify potential biomarkers using fold changes, Z-scores, and relationship between transcripts and their corresponding proteins
